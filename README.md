1. The book is available for purchase as a paperback on Amazon at: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DBVKXLZ

3. I would *love* it if you would put [your comments here](https://github.com/alan412/LearnJavaForFTC/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=book-comments.md&title=)   

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the POWERPLAY (2022-2023) competition season.

All of the samples were tested with it.
